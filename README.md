### Hello! I'm Olena

I’m a Computer Vision Engineer with 3 years of professional experience primarly working at Samusng R&D Institute. I have successfully designed and implemented deep learning solutions for complex computer vision challenges, including **depth estimation**, **3D object tracking**, **segmentation**, **room layout estimation** as well as worked with **human pose estimation** and other computer vision problems.

### Featured Projects

#### [1. AR Object Color Change with YOLO-NAS and SAM](https://github.com/Ramina16/AR_objects_color_change) (In Progress)
**Description**: Developed an AR application allowing users to change the color of indoor objects in real-time. Fine-tuned and quantized the YOLO-NAS model for object detection, exporting it as an optimized ONNX model for mobile use. The project aims to integrate the SAM model to segment detected objects and enable color modification. Currently, the YOLO-NAS fine-tuning and quantization are complete, with SAM integration planned next.

#### [2. Deploying deep learning model on mobile device](https://github.com/Ramina16/Quantization)
**Description**: Trained and quantized a DNN for images classification using ONNX for efficient mobile deployment. Integrated it into an Android app, enabling real-time image and video classification while optimizing inference speed and memory usage.  
**Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, ONNX, Kotlin

#### [3. 3D Reconstruction](https://github.com/Ramina16/3D_reconstruction)
**Description**: Implemented two 3D reconstruction pipelines: one leveraging depth estimation for scene reconstruction and another utilizing COLMAP for structure-from-motion and sparse reconstruction.  
**Tech Stack**: Python, COLMAP

#### [4. Stereo images rectification](https://github.com/Ramina16/images_rectification)
**Description**: This project focuses on stereo images rectification for two cases: with unknown and known camera intrinsics parameters.  
**Tech Stack**: Python

#### 5. Website for Repair Appliances services (coming soon)
**Description**: This website offers appliance repair services with appointment scheduling and a ‘call me’ form. FastAPI and PostgreSQL handle backend and data management, while JavaScript powers the frontend. Submissions trigger Telegram notifications for real-time updates.  
**Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS , Telegram Bot  
[In developing] [Backend](https://github.com/Ramina16/website_appliances), [Frontend](https://github.com/Ramina16/appliances-frontend)
